<h1>Getting Started with Studio One 2</h1>
<p>Studio One 2 is a very powerful Digital Audio Workstation with many features, but it can be daunting to jump in and
    start creating music, with how complex the software appears. The goal of this course is to get you up and running,
    ready to create.</p>


<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>First, plug in all of your midi/recording devices, then start up Studio One 2.
    You'll need to open up a new song. Do this by clicking through the song setup wizard.</p>
<img src="images/step1_1.PNG"  alt="Step 1.1" class="wideImg" />
<p>In the window that opens, you'll find you can select a preset on the left (if you wish), but for the
    purposes of this tutorial we'll stick with an empty song.<br />You may also set the name, tempo, and time
    signature here.</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Now that you have your song file open, you may find that there are many ways to start. Here, we'll walk through
    each of them. Start by clicking the "Add Track" button, pictured below.</p>
<img src="images/step2_1.png"  alt="Step 2.1" class="wideImg" />
<p>Next, give your track a name, and choose what type you want. You'll probably want either Instrument or Audio.</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Audio</h2>
<p>If you've selected an audio track, you should be ready to go! Just click record, and get recording! If things
    don't work, make sure the buttons highlighted below have been enabled.</p>
<img src="images/step3_1.png"  alt="Step 3.1" class="wideImg" />
<h2>Step 3 - Instrument</h2>
<p>If you've selected an instrument track, there is a bit of setup required. You need to select a virtual instrument.
You can do this by selecting "Instruments" from the right hand panel...</p>
<img src="images/step3_2.png"  alt="Step 3.2" class="wideImg" />
<p>...and dragging your desired instrument to the track.</p>
<img src="images/step3_3.png"  alt="Step 3.3" class="wideImg" />
<p>Once you have your instrument, you can record using a midi controller if you have one (it will work the same way
as recording to an audio track - see above), or you can double-click on the track and drag the end of the
created event to make it longer...</p>
<img src="images/step3_4.png"  alt="Step 3.4" class="wideImg" />
<p>...and double-click the event to open the "edit" window. In the edit window, you can use the cursor tool (press 1)
to allow double-clicking to add or remove notes, or you can use the 6 custom tools highlighted below
for their (self-explanatory) purposes.</p>

<h2>Exporting</h2>
<p>Once you have your track assembled, you will want to export it to an audio file. Do this by opening the marker track...</p>
<img src="images/step4_1.png"  alt="Step 4.1" class="wideImg" />
<p>...moving your "Start" and "End" markers to their corresponding spots in your track (you may have to scroll
awhile to find them)...</p>
<img src="images/step4_2.png"  alt="Step 4.2" class="wideImg" />
<p>Next, navigate to song->Export Mixdown...</p>
<img src="images/step4_3.png"  alt="Step 4.3" class="wideImg" />
<p>...select "Between Song Start/End Marker", and optionally rename the file at the top of the window and/or select a
different file location. You can also optionally change your export file format. When you're ready, hit "Ok" to export.</p>
