        I am currently a student at BCIT in the CST program.
        My primary interests include music (performance, analysis, composition), soccer, theology/christianity, and programming,
        but my range of interests expands far beyond that. I enjoy analysing linguistics and etymologies, psychological or sociological phenomena,
        and the reasoning behind certain design choices (whether visual or functional). For a job, I would love to land in the game dev scene,
        working to create games that will draw users in simply because the game is enjoyable, and not because of gambling or exploitive techniques.
        If I can spend my time improving people's lives, I count that as a victory.

                    <dd>
                        Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating orally and in writing with their supervisors, colleagues and clients.
                        As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in industry, you need to communicate quickly, clearly, and effectively.
                        This course will teach you how to be a professional and efficient communicator at work. You will write effective business correspondence and
                        instructions and deliver a formal oral presentation to your set. The first term establishes the principles and basic patterns on which you will
                        build more advanced applications in the second term.

                    <dd>
                        The course covers topics of importance to new and continuing students on how to balance school and related activities to
                        enhance chances of success in their academic careers. In this course students will learn a variety of different techniques to improve
                        study habits, note taking, and time management skills. The class will also present other topics of interest to CST students and will
                        introduce students to various support systems at BCIT.

                        This hands-on course is the foundation for all future programming courses and complements COMP 1536 and COMP 1910.
                        This course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming including design, development, testing, debugging simple programs,
                        as well as error-handling, and problem solving.

                    <li>COMP1712 Biz Analysis and System Design</li>
                    <dd>
                        Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes and tools that professionals use to plan and develop
                        information systems to industry standards. Students learn how to ask implicit questions, to create and document communication plans
                        and to make better decisions prior to creating a software system. Beginning with an introduction to the
                        Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), students work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems,
                        discover requirements and create a logical design. Topics include: techniques used in the discovery of business requirements,
                        traditional approaches to data and process modelling, entity-relationship diagrams, and an introduction to relational database normalization.
                        Agile life cycles such as Scrum are also introduced and compared to more planned life cycles such as waterfall.
                        By the end of this course, successful participants will be able to use tools and methods commonly used in industry to
                        analyze, design, and implement information systems as confirmed by a term project.

                        Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations. The purpose of this course is to give
                        a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The course is divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and
                        design of logic circuits; (2) number systems and data representation; and (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.

                        Students learn to work in a collaborative environment and complete a small-scale software project: a web app.
                        Design and managing of implementation concepts will be introduced: User Experience Design (XSD) and Agile methodology.
                        The course takes students through the UX design process which includes creating and administering surveys & interviews,
                        creating personas and user stories, designing wireframes, and performing user tests with a developed implementation that is
                        based on the UX design process. Students will use the Agile methodology to manage the software process.
                        Software management workflow also includes using version control, version control basics, utilizing web technologies
                        (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, data persistence via NoSQL data technologies). Some of the JavaScript topics include DOM manipulation,
                        event handling, web storage, AJAX calls and using JQuery in order to create a rich web app.

                        client-side scripting with JavaScript, server-side scripting, and best practices. COMP 1536 will provide students with
                        a solid understanding about how web applications are constructed and deployed. Students will be taught to use
                        client-side RAD tools in order to enhance their productivity. Students will complete a number of assignments and exams as well as one larger project.
