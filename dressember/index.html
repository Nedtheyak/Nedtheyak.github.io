				<h1>Dressember 2020</h1>
				<p>
					I'm doing a campaign where I wear a tie all day every day in December, raising awareness and money for the <a href="https://www.ijm.ca/our-work">International Justice Mission (IJM)</a>. They work to rescue people from human trafficking and slavery, and have been doing so for over 20 years.
					<br /><br />
					There are about 40 million people being trafficked right now, and we can change that.
					<br /><br />
					To go to my campaign page, <a href="https://dressemberijm-2020.funraise.org/fundraiser/kayden-schmidt/">click here</a>!
